Weekly Individual Project Update Report

Group number: L1-G9

Student name: Karthikeyan Bhavani Shankar

Week: Week 4 (Feb 04 – Feb 06)

1. How many hours did you spend on the project this week?
   
5 hours

2. Breakdown of hours spent:
   
Top item: Component verification and circuit planning – 2 hours

2nd item: Software logic preparation and documentation updates – 3 hours

3. What did you accomplish this week?

-Reviewed and double-checked all ordered components to ensure compatibility with the Raspberry Pi and relay control system.

-Designed and finalized the transistor driver circuit (NPN transistor, base resistor, flyback diode) for safe relay operation.

-Prepared GPIO pin mapping and control logic structure for relay-based water pump automation.

-Organized and cleaned up project documentation to reflect the updated hardware configuration.

-Planned testing procedures for soil moisture, temperature, and humidity integration once components arrive

4. How do you feel about your progress?
   
-I feel good thinking about the progress that we made this week.

-Although we are currently waiting for the ordered components to arrive, this time was used productively to prepare circuit designs and control logic in advance.

-This preparation will allow for faster implementation once the hardware is available.

5. What are you planning to do next week?

-Begin physical hardware assembly once components arrive.

-Test soil moisture sensor readings on the Raspberry Pi.

-Implement and test relay switching logic with proper transistor driving.

-Integrate temperature and humidity monitoring into the system. 

6. Is anything blocking you that you need from others?
   
Currently waiting for the components to arrive. No other blockers at this time.
