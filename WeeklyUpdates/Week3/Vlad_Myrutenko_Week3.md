1. ***How many hours did you spend on the project this week?***

   3 Hours


2. ***Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:***

- **Meetings:** 1 Hour

- **Information Gathering / Evaluating Options:** 2 Hours


3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_

- Collaborated with the team to move away from the original autonomous rover concept. We finalized a more feasible "Greenhouse Monitoring System" featuring automated feedback loops for environmental control.
- Participated in group discussions to define project roles and responsibilities for each member.


4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_

  - I feel that my progress was somewhat slow at the beginning of the week. I found it difficult to dive deep into research without a finalized team consensus on the project direction. However, since we solidified our idea on Thursday, I feel much more ready to move into the design phase.


5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_

  - Carefully review the Technical Requirements to ensure the greenhouse system meets all necessary complexity standards.

  - Work with the team to complete the draft Project Proposal by the Jan 27 deadline.

  - Begin looking into the basic UML diagrams required for the proposal.


6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_

  - I am currently unable to see our private group channel on Microsoft Teams. Our team has been using Discord as a workaround, but I am aware that we need a written record of communications on the official platform.
