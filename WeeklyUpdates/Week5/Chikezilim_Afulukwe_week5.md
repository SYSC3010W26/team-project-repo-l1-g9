What did you accomplish this week? (Be specific)

Participated in team meetings to finalize the Automated Greenhouse system direction and overall architecture.

Reviewed the finalized project proposal to ensure alignment with the planned system design and implementation approach.

Assisted in identifying and confirming required hardware components for soil moisture sensing, irrigation control, and environmental monitoring.

Contributed to discussions around how sensors and Raspberry Pi hardware will be integrated and tested in upcoming implementation phases.

How do you feel about your progress?

I feel confident about my progress this week.
The project scope and system architecture are now clearly defined, and the team has a shared understanding of responsibilities and next steps. This sets a solid foundation for transitioning from planning into hands-on implementation.

What are you planning to do next week? (Give specific goals)

Begin hands-on testing with sensors and Raspberry Pi hardware.

Assist with collecting and validating sensor data.

Help test initial automation logic and communication between system components.

Continue collaborating closely with the team to support hardware and software integration.

Is anything blocking you that you need from others?

There are no major blockers at this time.
I am waiting for the arrival of the requested components so that full hardware testing and integration can begin.
