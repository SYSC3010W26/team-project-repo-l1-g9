Week: Week 4 (Wed–Fri, Jan 21st to Jan 23rd)

How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0–10)

4–5 hours

Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1–3 of the following:

Top item: Reviewing and contributing to the project proposal – 2 hours

2nd item: Team discussions and coordination – 1.5 hours

3rd item: Research and planning for hardware/sensor setup – 1 hour

What did you accomplish this week?

Reviewed the project proposal and provided input on system design and overall structure.

Participated in team discussions to align on project goals, responsibilities, and next steps.

Contributed to planning how the hardware components and sensors will be integrated into the system once implementation begins.

How do you feel about your progress?

I feel satisfied with my progress this week. While most of the work focused on planning and documentation rather than implementation, it was necessary to ensure clarity and coordination across the team before moving forward.

What are you planning to do next week?

Begin hands-on work with sensors and Raspberry Pi hardware.

Help integrate sensor data into the system.

Assist with testing communication between system components.

Continue collaborating closely with the team during the transition into implementation.

Is anything blocking you that you need from others?

There are no major blockers at the moment. We may need additional discussion as a team regarding sensor configuration and specific hardware requirements before full implementation begins.
