Top item: Team meetings and coordination, 2 hours
2nd item: Writing and refining the project proposal, 2 hours
3rd item: Planning system integration and sensor testing, 1 hour

3. What did you accomplish this week? 

-	Met up with the team to discuss overall progress from each side(their ideas/suggestions) and proceed on next steps for the project itself.
-	Worked collaboratively on writing and editing sections of the project proposal, including the proposed design and hardware/software descriptions.
-	Participated in planning discussions for transitioning from proposal work to actual system integration and sensor testing next week.


4. How do you feel about your progress? 

I feel good about the progress made this week. Although most of the work focused on planning and documentation, it was important for ensuring that the whole team was on the same page and has a clear and shared understanding of the 
system before starting implementation. 

5. What are you planning to do next week? 
-	Hands-on testing with sensors and Raspberry Pi hardware.
-	Assist with integrating sensor data collection into the system.
-	Help test data communication between nodes and the cloud backend.
-	Continue coordinating with the team as implementation begins.

6. Is anything blocking you that you need from others? 

No major blockers at this time. However we have to discuss sensor configuration and other things before we actually start getting into the project.
