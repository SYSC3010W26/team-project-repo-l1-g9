Weekly Individual Project Update Report (WIPUR)
Group number: L1-G9
Student name: Karthikeyan Bhavani Shankar
Week: Week 1 (Wed-Fri,Jan 14th to Jan 16th )

1. How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0–10)
6 hours

2. Rough breakdown of hours spent (1–3 items)
i. Project planning, requirements analysis, and brainstorming — 3 hours
ii. Research on similar systems (IoT greenhouse monitoring & automation) — 2 hours
iii. Team discussions and role delegation — 1 hour

3. What did you accomplish this week? (Be specific)
•	Contributed in finalizing the project scope as “IoT-based Environmental Monitoring and Assisted Automation System for Greenhouse Spaces,”.
•	Participated in team discussions to remove autonomous robotics from the design to reduce mechanical complexity and give more focus on stationary automation.
•	Helped explain the system architecture involving multiple Raspberry Pis, cloud communication, a central controller, and an app-based GUI.
•	Came to a conclusion in adding features such as sprinkler control and simulated pH or pesticide dosing triggered by sensor thresholds..

4. How do you feel about your progress? (brief reflection)
I feel very confident as far as of now about the progress made this week. We initially made sure we understood the project scope. Establishing clear roles and agreeing on assisted automation gives the project a strong direction moving forward. Overall, this week provided a solid foundation for implementation.

5. What are you planning to do next week? (give specific goals)
•	Help define detailed functional requirements for the system.
•	Assist in creating a block diagram and data flow description for the project.
•	Begin outlining the control logic for environmental thresholds and automation triggers.
•	Support initial setup of Raspberry Pi communication with the cloud 

6. Is anything blocking you that you need from others? (What do you need from whom)
No major blockers currently. Coordination with teammates will be required for the sensor integration of the project but as of now nothing is currently preventing progress.
