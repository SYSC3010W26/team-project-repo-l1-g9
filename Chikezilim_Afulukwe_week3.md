## 1. How many hours did you spend on the project this week?
3 hours

---

## 2. Rough breakdown of hours spent
i. Team meetings and discussions — 1 hour  
ii. Information gathering and evaluating alternative project concepts — 2 hours

## 3. What did you accomplish this week?
- Collaborated with the team to move away from the original autonomous rover concept and finalize a more feasible **IoT-based Greenhouse Monitoring System** with automated environmental feedback loops.
- Participated in discussions to clearly define project roles and responsibilities for each team member.
- Contributed to aligning the project direction toward stationary automation to reduce mechanical complexity and improve reliability.

## 4. How do you feel about your progress?
At the beginning of the week, progress felt slower due to uncertainty around the final project direction. However, once the team reached consensus on the greenhouse monitoring system, I felt significantly more confident and motivated. Establishing a clear and realistic scope has positioned the project well for the upcoming design and implementation phases.

## 5. What are you planning to do next week?
- Review the technical requirements to ensure the greenhouse system meets the required complexity and functionality standards.
- Collaborate with the team to complete the draft **Project Proposal** before the January 27 deadline.
- Begin researching and outlining basic UML diagrams required for the proposal documentation.

## 6. Is anything blocking you that you need from others?
I am currently unable to access our private group channel on Microsoft Teams. While we have been communicating through Discord as a temporary solution, access to the official Teams channel will be needed to maintain a proper record of communication.
